## Requirements
You'll need Docker 🎣. I've failed too many times trying to install Golang on my host machine, switch versions, keep packages in order on my Mac machine. Thus Docker is used.

## Usage 🔧 💡
`make tinygo_build` to build with TinyGo compiler; produces kilobytes version 😻

`make tinygo_build` to build with Go compiler; produces megabytes version 😿

`make run` to open browser & launch nginx
