You'll need Docker 🎣.

_I've failed too many times trying to install Golang on my host machine, switch versions, keep packages in order on my Mac machine. Thus Docker is used._

## Usage 🔧
`make tinygo_build` with TinyGo compiler; produce kilobytes version 😻

`make tinygo_build` with Go compiler; produces megabytes version 😿

`make run` to open browser & launch nginx 🧶
